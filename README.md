# Guess The Number : Game

The "Guess the Number" project is a simple game written in Python that allows the user to guess a randomly generated number between a specified range. The program utilizes the random library function to generate the number, and the user is prompted to input their guess. If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint whether the guess was too high or too low, and the user is allowed to try again. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number and prompts the user to play again. The project provides a basic introduction to using the random library in Python and demonstrates how to incorporate user input and conditional statements to create a simple game.
